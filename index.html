          <p>
            A full-stack web application featuring a gallery and shop powered by a backend service.
            While the content is illustration-based, the primary focus of this project was designing,
            building, and deploying a working frontend–backend system.

    <section id="about">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I spent 11 years working as a C-level Executive Assistant, most recently in a fast-paced FinTech environment.
        While supporting the CPO and CTO, I worked closely with engineering and product teams, which sparked my interest
        in how software is built and shipped.
      </p>
      <p>
        I retrained in software development through a Professional Certificate in Full Stack Software Engineering with IBM
        and three Code First Girls Kickstarters. Since then, I’ve made learning part of my daily routine, building and
        deploying small web applications to strengthen my understanding of core concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m now focused on continuing to grow as a developer and am seeking a junior software development role as the first
        step in a long-term career in technology.
