            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I spent 11 years working as a C-level Executive Assistant, most recently in a fast-paced FinTech environment. While supporting the CPO and CTO, I worked closely with engineering and product teams, which sparked my interest in how software is built and shipped.</p>
            <p>I retrained in software development through a Professional Certificate in Full Stack Software Engineering with IBM and three Code First Girls Kickstarters. Since then, I’ve made learning part of my daily routine, building and deploying small web applications to strengthen my understanding of core concepts.</p>
            <p>I’m now focused on continuing to grow as a developer and am seeking a junior software development role as the first step in a long-term career in technology.</p>
